# It seems to be impossible to fix all of them to at least 8/10? especially for Q3 I tried more than 5 time to fix it but the score doesn't
change anymore. I guess there could be a problem with pylint?  Also we have to delete a lot of long comments to make it looks like PEP8. However we don't really like it because it could make our code less readable.
